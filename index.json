This paper examines how US monetary policy affects productivity in non-US economies through allocative efficiency. We develop a two-country model featuring dollar dominance in trade and misallocations from markup heterogeneity. When US monetary policy tightens, dollar appreciation affects non-US economies through two channels. First, it lowers the marginal costs in dollars of non-US exporters, causing large export firms with high markups that underproduce relative to the efficient allocation to incompletely pass through these changes, thereby increasing their markups further. Second, in domestic markets, dollar appreciation raises import prices, easing competitive pressures for local producers. Both effects reallocate resources from large, high-markup firms to small, low-markup firms, worsening allocative efficiency. Using plant-level data from Chile and Colombia, where trade is predominantly invoiced in dollars, we provide evidence of factor reallocation from high-markup to low-markup firms following US monetary tightening.","tags":null,"title":"Productivity and Misallocation Dynamics under Dominant Currency Paradigm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yasutaka Koike-Mori","Antonio Martner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1725148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1725148800,"objectID":"3ea30b8a38a0d5b8792bb3a11c71d326","permalink":"https://yasutaka06.github.io/publication/wip2/","publishdate":"2024-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wip2/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Aggregating Distortions in Networks with Multi-Product Firms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Baqaee","Ariel Burstein","Yasutaka Koike-Mori"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1698710400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698710400,"objectID":"94b934df241df1f6628fc1fed075b7bd","permalink":"https://yasutaka06.github.io/publication/working-paper-2/","publishdate":"2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/working-paper-2/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Sufficient Statistics for Measuring Forward-Looking Welfare","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Baqaee","Ariel Burstein","Yasutaka Koike-Mori"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1688688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688688000,"objectID":"f65cba65d50f1e51af91b17b6d3aa5b9","permalink":"https://yasutaka06.github.io/publication/working-paper-1/","publishdate":"2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/working-paper-1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Measuring Welfare by Matching Households Across Time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yasutaka Koike-Mori","Koki Okumura"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"9bbb5023663d9a9651831d6c645cdade","permalink":"https://yasutaka06.github.io/publication/wip3/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wip3/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper investigates the interaction between production networks and firms' research and development (R\u0026D) decisions and their implications for aggregate inefficiency. Using Japanese inter-firm transaction and patent data, we document that older firms have more network connections and tend to connect with other older firms. Additionally, connected firms' R\u0026D stimulates innovation in their partner firms. Motivated by these empirical findings, we construct a model that incorporates the dynamics of production networks and R\u0026D as a new variety creation. In this model, firms gradually build their supply chains and can leverage their existing supply chains to develop and sell new products. Our model implies that older firms at the center of the production network underinvest in R\u0026D relative to the optimal allocation.","tags":null,"title":"Production Networks and R\u0026D Misallocaition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Huneeus","Yasutaka Koike-Mori","Antonio Martner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"b3e29f285d5792c90546bea97686c3e7","permalink":"https://yasutaka06.github.io/publication/wip4/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wip4/","section":"publication","summary":"We present an aggregation result that structurally dissects the drivers of aggregate productivity, i.e., technology and the reallocation of resources, across arbitrary parts of the economy using sufficient statistics that can be measured with standard datasets. Besides the typical statistics of factor shares and distortion changes, consumption share changes emerge as a new sufficient statistics that capture an income redistribution channel between households. This channel reflects how changes in households’ income propagate upstream, influencing the allocation of resources across firms. We apply our results to revisit Chile’s aggregate productivity stagnation since 2010, leveraging two decades of administrative firm-to-firm data. This stagnation is almost entirely driven by the reallocation of resources and in particular by expenditure changes of specific groups of the economy. Exports of mining, domestic output of manufacturing and retail, and incumbent large firms shape the bulk of this reallocation.","tags":null,"title":"The Anatomy of Aggregate Productivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yasutaka Koike-Mori","Toshitaka Maruyama","Koki Okumura"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670371200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670371200,"objectID":"bb5ed11bb3372583268aa727cd5b3b24","permalink":"https://yasutaka06.github.io/publication/wip1/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wip1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Inventor Mobility, Knowledge Diffusion, and Growth","type":"publication"}]
